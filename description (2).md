Dataset used in the CIMBC tutorial on ["Basic Metabolomics Data Analysis Workflow"](https://cimcb.github.io/MetabWorkflowTutorial/Tutorial1.html)

The tutorial describes the data as follows:

- The study used in this tutorial has been previously published as an open access article Chan et al. (2016), in the British Journal of Cancer.

- The deconvolved and annotated data file have been deposited at the Metabolomics Workbench data repository (Project ID PR000699). 

- The data can be accessed directly via its project DOI:10.21228/M8B10B 

- 1H-NMR spectra were acquired at Canadaâ€™s National High Field Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Centre (NANUC) using a 600 MHz Varian Inova spectrometer. 

- Spectral deconvolution and metabolite annotation was performed using the Chenomx NMR Suite v7.6. 

**Unfortunately, the Raw NMR data is unavailable.**
